# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(1 or 2 sentences describing your program)*
My program is designed to take the weather API and the calendar API and integrate them so that for each calendar day, the weather forecast is generated.

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(list any known bugs or non-working parts)*
The program requires libraries that I do not currently have downloaded on my computer, but it should work if they are downloaded.

## REFERENCES *(any resources you use outside of class materials)*

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(anything else you would like the grader to know)*
For the calendar API, there are several imports that do not show as working as a result of not having this library. Each google account requires signing in using a personal username and password, along with authorization code.
